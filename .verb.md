## Why use this?

- **Fast** - Loads in ~5ms (about _3 times faster than a [single frame of a HD movie][framerate] at 60fps_)
- **Light** - Only [one dependency](https://github.com/doowb/ansi-colors)
- **Easy to use** - Uses promises, so prompts are easy to run and use.
- **Extensible** - Prompts are easy to customize and extend. 
- **Stylish** - Easily override default colors and symbols for any part of the prompt.
- **Well tested** - All prompts are well-tested. Tests easy to create, without having to use hacky solutions to spy on prompts or pass values.

## Install

{%= include("install-npm", { save: true }) %}

```js
const Enquirer = require('enquirer');
const enquirer = new Enquirer();

// pass an array of "question" objects, or a single question object
const questions = [
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'name',
    message: 'What is your name?' 
  },
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'username',
    message: 'What is your username?' 
  },
  {
    type: 'confirm',
    name: 'persist',
    message: 'Want to save?'
  }
];

enquirer.prompt(questions)
  .then(values => {
    console.log('ANSWERS', values);
  });
```


## Question objects

Questions are objects that implement the following interface:

```js
interface Question {
  type: string;
  name: string;
  message: string;
}
```

### Question properties

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | **{string}** | Enquirer uses this value to determine the type of prompt to run, but it's optional when prompts are run directly. |
| `name` | **{string}** | Used as the key for the answer on the returned values (answers) object. |
| `message` | **{string}** | The message to display when the prompt is rendered in the terminal. |
