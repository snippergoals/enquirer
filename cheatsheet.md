## Terminology

Whenever possible, we attempted to use familiar concepts and terminology from HTML/CSS to describe prompt behavior and attributes. 

| **term** | **description** |
| --- | --- |
| `focused` | The currently targeted choice in a _visible_ list of choices. Similar in concept to focus in HTML and CSS. |
| `pointer` | Marks the choice that currently has focus. The `‚ùØ` symbol is often used for this, but the pointer is not always visible, as with the `autocomplete` prompt. |
| `indicator` | Designates whether or not a choice is checked/enabled.  |
| `index` | The zero-based position of the pointer in the visible list of choices.  |
| `cursor` | The zero-based position of the cursor relative to user input. |
| `selected` | The position of the currently choice. |
| `enabled` | The position of the currently choice. |
| `active` | The position of the currently choice. |


## Keypresses

### Move Cursor

## Themes

Themes define the palette of colors to be applied to the various sections of a prompt. 

### Theme styles

| `complementary` | `utils.complement`                   |   | 

The [ansi-colors][] library is used to apply styling. 

### Applying styles

If you are a prompt author, styles may be accessed inside a prompt instance on the `this.theme` object, where each "style" is a function that wraps the returned string in ANSI codes. 

## Events

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `state`  | A clone of the `prompt.state` object is emitted for each keypress. |
| `alert`  | Emitted when `prompt.alert()` is called. This is useful for detecting invalid keypresses when output is not visible in the terminal (as in unit tests). |
| `submit` | Emitted with the answer `value` when submitted by the user. |
| `cancel` | Emitted when the prompt is terminated by the user or an error is thrown. |
| `close`  | Emitted when the readline interface is closed and the input stream is paused. |
| `run`    | Emitted when the prompt has been initialized. |


## Events

| **Event name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `run`      | Emitted when the `.run()` method is called, after the [readline][] interface is created. |
| `keypress` |  |
| `state`    | Emitted at the same time as `keypress`, but emits the object returned from the [prompt.state()](#state) method. This object has useful state properties such as [status](#property-status) [cursor](#property-cursor) [value](#property-value) [typed](#property-typed) [error](#property-error) etc. |
| `submit`   |  |
| `abort`    | Emitted when an error occurs or when the user terminates the session early. |
