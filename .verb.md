## Prompt types

**What is a prompt "type"?**

Prompt types determine the type of question - or prompt - to initiate. Currently, the only prompt type that ships with enquirer is `input`. 

These following additional prompt types are available as plugins:

{%= related(verb.related.prompts) %}

Or you can use [enquirer-prompts][], if you want a bundle with all of the listed prompt types.

### Publishing prompt types

Prompt modules are named using the convention `prompt-*`.

## Why another prompt module?

We use prompts extensively in our projects, and we wanted to improve the user experience and reduce dependencies associated with other libraries we tried, like Inquirer. 

Our main goals were:

- reduce initial load time
- make prompt-types easier to add
- make code footprint smaller

**Initial load time**

Enquirer takes **~11ms** to load. This is about the same amount of time that it takes [chalk][] to load.

By comparison, Inquirer takes **~120ms just to load**!!! This is about how long it takes babel, or other massive libraries that you would never include in production code.

Regardless of whether or not a prompt is every actually used, your own application will be 120ms slower from having Inquirer in its dependency tree. This is caused by its own massive dependency tree, code redundancy, monolithic and slow [reactive interface][rx] (which makes little sense for this use case anyway), poor API design (Inquirer actually executes code, even if you never call the library!), and so on. 

120ms might not seem like a lot, but there is a critical threshold where performance of an application begins to feel laggy, and having inquirer in your dependency tree cuts into that threshold significantly, leaving less room for everything else.

**Make prompts easier to add**

Inquirer uses a [reactive interface][rx] for flow control. Aside from being overkill and not offering and real code advantages, to work with the code you need to be familiar with microsoft's RX first. This makes it a pain to add new prompt types (e.g. you probably won't).

Regarding the specific "merits" of RX alone, we think it's overkill, makes the application slow, bloated, hard to maintain, hard to contribute to, and difficult to extend. Events are sufficient.

**Code footprint**

By moving prompt types into separate libraries, we're able to keep the core library small and fast. Moreover, implementors and authors can create their own prompt types without having to require enquirer itself (unlike inquirer). This also makes the individual prompt libraries easier to maintain.
