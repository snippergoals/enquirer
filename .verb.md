## Prompt types

**What is a prompt "type"?**

Prompt types determine the type of question - or prompt - to initiate. Currently, the only prompt type that ships with enquirer is `input`. 

These following additional prompt types are available as plugins:

{%= related(verb.related.prompts) %}

Or you can use [enquirer-prompts][], if you want a bundle with all of the listed prompt types.

### Publishing prompt types

Prompt modules are named using the convention `prompt-*`.

## Why another prompt module?

We use prompts extensively in our projects, and we wanted to improve the user experience and reduce dependencies associated with other libraries we tried, like Inquirer. 

Our main goals were:

- reduce initial load time
- make prompt-types easier to add
- make code footprint smaller
